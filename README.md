# covid19 data analyze with SQL
In this project I used data from [<b>Our World in Data</b>](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)

I used SQL to show things like:
<ul>
  <li>total injured people VS total deaths and count the percentage.</li>
  <li>total injured people VS total population in each country and count the percentage.</li>
  <li>countries with highest infection rate compared to population.</li>
  <li>countries with highest death.</li>
  <li>total daily new cases and new deaths globally.</li>
  <li>total population VS new vaccinations.</li>
  <li>percentage of vaccinated people of population.</li>
 </ul>
